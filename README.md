Steganography is the process of concealing data within a file so that the concealed data is noteasily identifiable. Unlike encryption, steganography does not make it immediately apparent to athird party that data has been masked. This method of hiding data allows secure datatransmission through public channels and is particularly useful to citizens in countries that havestrict data encryption laws.

Our project will build on https://github.com/Jpadilla1/Steganography, a repository that usessteganography to hide text or images inside of images. We will be creating a user interface forthis project that allows the user to hide text in an image and, if time allows, team members willexplore adding additional functionality to the program.

Team members will be responsible for the following:

●Sifa and Ayisha will design and implement an interface design for the program. Theywill make sure that the interface is intuitive and easy to use, while also being visuallyappealing.

●Zack will implement file I/O. He will create a “Browse” button that will prompt the user tobrowse for a source image and he will create a method that allows the user to set thefilename/path for the destination image.

●Jon will create an image preview that shows the user the source image they’ve selectedto mask data inside of.

●Ary will handle errors. She will ensure that common errors (such as unsupported filetype or failed file creation) produce output that is easily identifiable to the user.

Additional features to be implemented if time allows (tentative):

●Image masking - The user will be able to select an image to hide inside of the sourceimage.

●Data encryption - The masked data will be encrypted before it is merged with theimage. A passphrase will be required to encrypt and decrypt the data.

●Help text - A compiled help (.chm) file will be written that teaches the user how to usethe program effectively
