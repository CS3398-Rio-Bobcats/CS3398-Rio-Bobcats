Steganography is the process of concealing data within a file so that the concealed data is not easily identifiable. Unlike encryption, steganography does not make it immediately apparent to a third party that data has been masked. This method of hiding data allows secure data transmission through public channels and is particularly useful to citizens in countries that have strict data encryption laws.

Our project will build on https://github.com/Jpadilla1/Steganography, a repository that uses steganography to hide text or images inside of images. We will be creating a user interface for this project that allows the user to hide text in an image and, if time allows, team members will explore adding additional functionality to the program.

Team members will be responsible for the following:

● Sifa and Ayisha will design and implement an interface design for the program. They will make sure that the interface is intuitive and easy to use, while also being visuallyappealing.

● Zack will implement file I/O. He will create a “Browse” button that will prompt the user to browse for a source image and he will create a method that allows the user to set thefilename/path for the destination image.

● Jon will create an image preview that shows the user the source image they’ve selected to mask data inside of.

● Ary will handle errors. She will ensure that common errors (such as unsupported filetype or failed file creation) produce output that is easily identifiable to the user.

Additional features to be implemented if time allows (tentative):

● Image masking - The user will be able to select an image to hide inside of the source image.

● Data encryption - The masked data will be encrypted before it is merged with the image. A passphrase will be required to encrypt and decrypt the data.

● Help text - A compiled help (.chm) file will be written that teaches the user how to use the program effectively
